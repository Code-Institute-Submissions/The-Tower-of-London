            <strong>The White Tower is built by William the Conqueror.</strong>
            <p> Also known as William I, he was the first Norman king of England, reigning from 1066 until his death in 1087.
            At the time, the Tower was seen as a resented symbol of the new Norman ruling class. You can read more about the Tower <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_London">here.</a>

            <strong>The Inner Ward is built in the reign of Richard the Lionheart.</strong> 
            <p>The Inner Ward doubled the castle's size, and has 13 towers along the curtain wall, including the 13th century Beauchamp tower.
            As a result of the expansion, St. Peter ad Vincula, a Norman chapel, was incorporated into the Tower walls. Some of its best known prisoners are buried at the chapel, including Queen Anne Boleyn, Queen Catherine Howard and Sir Thomas More.

              <strong>Murder of the Princes in the Tower.</strong> <p> The Princes were Edward V of England and his brother, Richard of Shrewsbury, Duke of York. They were never seen again after being sent to heavily guarded lodgings in the Tower.
            An Italian friar named Dominic Mancini noted that after Richard III seized the throne, the two princes were never seen again. Although there is no hard evidence, it is widely believed the young boys were murdered by their uncle, Richard III.
              Although 4 sets of remains have been found in the Tower and considered to possibly be connected to the Princes, the Church of England, with backing from the late Queen Elizabeth II and ministers,

                <strong>Anne Boleyn is executed.</strong>
                <p>Queen Anne Boleyn had been the love of Henry VIII's life - so much so that he broke away from Rome, made himself Supreme Head of the Church of England and 
                  divorced his loyal first wife, Katherine of Aragon. But Anne failed to provide Henry a son and heir. It is believed that Henry's chief minister, Thomas Cromwell, was responsible for the plot to get rid of Queen Anne. She was excuted at the Tower with a sword on the 15th of May, 1536.

             He was discovered in the cellars of the Palace of Westminster where he was arrested and taken to the Tower and tortured. He was due to be hung, drawn and quatered, but on the 31st January, 1606, Guy fell - some say jumped - from the scoffold, breaking his neck and dying instantly.

                <p>Self-styled 'Colonel' Thomas Blood was somthing of a <a target="_blank" a href="https://www.thehistorypress.co.uk/articles/colonel-blood-and-the-crown-jewels/">legend in his own lifetime.</a>
              Born into a wealthy family around 1618 in Ireland, Blood and 4 armed men attempted to steal the crown jewels on May 9th, 1601. The Keeper of the Jewel House was left for dead, and the gang made off with the crown and orb before being apprehended. Blood refused to speak to anyone but King Charles II. The King spoke to him, and Blood was somehow pardoned and even given lands. Some said the King was in on the plot, others said he was merely amused at Blood's audacity.
